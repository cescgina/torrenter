Torrenter
=========

Simple torrent client, copied from the *pieces* repository, by Markus Eliasson (see the original
        [code](https://github.com/eliasson/pieces) or consult its [blog post](https://markuseliasson.se/article/bittorrent-in-python/) for
        more details)

This is not intended for serious use, just a toy project
